    "Content": "The HCS-3DX system introduces an AI-driven micromanipulator that revolutionizes the handling and selection of 3D spheroids, commonly referred to as '-oids'. By integrating AI technologies, the system can achieve morphological pre-selection alongside automated pipetting, significantly enhancing the consistency and reliability of transferring spheroids, vital for detailed high-content screening (HCS). This ensures that only the most homogeneous spheroids are selected, improving experimental reproducibility and enabling complex drug screening applications at the single-cell level.",
    "Source": "HCS-3DX is based on three main components: an automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven micromanipulator for oid selection...AI-driven systems for manipulating and selecting similar aggregates are proposed [10, 11, 12]. For instance, AI-driven micromanipulators combining morphological pre-selection with automated pipetting systems, reduce time and ensure reliability when transferring spheroids to the imaging plates [13].",
